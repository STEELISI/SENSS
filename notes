#Open SENSS server/client at html/{Server/Client}/exps/{server/client}.php
#should be customized for client or server (after all you know which one you're setting up, you just asked for this info) and it doesnt have html in the URL

#Change buttons in config to
#  - config this client
#  - config link to remote server

#Config SENSS client forces cert upload but we said it is either this or server-specific certs

#For certificate give some text like RPKI certificate or server-issued certificate, say something about which format this should be in

#For server URL give an example so that they understand they need the full URL

#It would be nice to have edit and remove not just remove 

#I should be able to remove just the certificate for the node and upload new one (back to the edit issue)

Picture with two SENSS servers is wrong
-- Sivaram: Let me talk to you in person about this. I want to see how you generated this. 

#Client should be able to link to detector logs and know how to take signature from detector. 
#I think you already have this functionality so you can add in configuration an optional "link to detector"
